  <h1>RVA Must Sees</h1>

  <p>Richmond is the capital of the great state of Virginia, one of the original 13 states. As such there are a number of things one must do, when visiting the city.

  I suggest starting with the James river, a staple of Richmond summers and how the city got it's name. Richmond's founder came up with the name as an homage to a similar city in London, which also sat next to a winding river.

  Next I suggest stopping by The Diamond, to catch a Flying Squrriels game. During the holidays, the Diamond hosts various events for the community.

  No trip to Richmond is complete without visiting one of our historic neighborhoods. One of my favorites is Church Hill. Home to a great BBQ restaurant, and where Patrick Henry gave his famous speech, Give me Liberty or Give me Death!"

  No matter what you do in Richmond you are sure to run into Broad Street. Broad Street runs directly through Richmond, and it is the street which never sleeps. Another famous street in Richmond, is less of a street and more of an avenue. I am of course talking about Monument Avenue. Monument avenue is widely known for the statues of Confederate soliders, but I am here to highlight the statue of Arther Ashe. The African American tennis phenome who went from practicing his serve in Battery Park to winning three grand slam titles

  There is no way to cover all of what Richmond has to offer, you just have to come and visit for yourself.</p>
